	// In Java and other object-oriented languages,
	// an object is a collection of data that provides a set of methods. 
	// For example, Scanner object, which we used to capture user input,
	// is an object that provides methods for parsing/capturing input. 
	// System.out is also an object and we used its print() and println() methods to display our output.
	// Strings are objects, too. 
	// They contain characters and provide methods for manipulating character data.
